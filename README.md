### Introduction
BrightTV is a subscription-based entertainment platform with a strategic goal to expand its subscriber base during the current financial year. The CEO has tasked the Customer Value Management (CVM) team with uncovering actionable insights from user profile and viewership transaction data. These insights will inform content strategy, user engagement initiatives, and growth opportunities.

### Objectives
This case study aims to address the following:

- Analyze user and usage trends to understand viewing behavior.
- Identify key factors influencing content consumption.
- Recommend content strategies to boost engagement on low-consumption days.
- Propose initiatives to grow BrightTV’s user base through data-driven actions.

### Recommendations

To boost engagement on quieter days like Monday and Wednesday:

 - Catch-Up Capsules: Recap top content from the weekend.
 - Interactive Polls & Quizzes: Gamified formats to spark participation.
 - Behind-the-Scenes or Creator Spotlights: Build emotional connection and loyalty.
 - Countdowns or Teasers: Create anticipation for upcoming drops.
 - Localized Content: Feature region-specific stories or shoutouts (especially for Gauteng, Western Cape, and KZN).
